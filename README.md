# TheUncommonScripts
A place for all my uncommon scripts. I mainly work in a Windows environment so my Linux knowledge is limited.

Everyone is free to do what they will with these scripts...

CollectDisabledUsers.ps1

As the name suggets, this script checks the AD using RSAT and the AD module to collect a list of AD accounts that are no longer active/disabled then exports that list to a text file.

LogCollector.sh

This script is a log collection at it's most basic form for the linux environment. You may modify this to your specfic needs as you wish.

LogCollector.ps1

This script is similar to the Linux Log Collector but this is more refined and for use in the Windows environment.
